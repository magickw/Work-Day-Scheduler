# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
This project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Getting Started


## Process
* Step 1. Creating time slots for a working day.<br>
This step is implemented in html file by slicing a 9am-5pm working day into 9 time slots. A basic structure is thus created. Assign every time slot a value for example 9, 10 11 and so on in order to determine which time slots are past, current or future by comparing them with the current hour. <br>

* Step 2. <br>

* Step 3. <br>

* Step 4. <br>
